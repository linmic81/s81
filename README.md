Understand how the capacity works in this environment from the ground up.

Need to understand for each generation of ICP, 1.5, 2.0, 2.0


ow do we document 
We need to understand for each generation of ICP, particular ICP 1.5,  - 

How are we managing capacity from the ground up?
How do we document this in such way so that we can get that information in front the rest of operate space
you guys can run sessions to keep us updated on how this works.

becuase in my opinion,  there is no experts in the operate space anywhere understand how this done
everybody look at eachother has 15 ideas and no body really knows.
I think that's the the case for engineering also too,

that's Step 0
------------------------------------------

How do we differentiate between psyical available hardware capacity 
and logical over subscribe capacity.

How is alerting working to let us know when we over subscripe something
and we complete exaust psysical capacity

2.0, 2.0

Goal is they suppose to 
add node to expand compute,
add node to expand memory, 
to add additional storage to the ScaleIO cluster to expand storage.
