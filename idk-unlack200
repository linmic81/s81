1. Download
Download the JDK from Oracle

2. Extract
If you want to use the x86 version simply open the .exe file with 7-Zip. 
It contains a single file tools.zip, which contains all the files we need.

For x64 the tools.zip can be found in .rsrc\1033\JAVA_CAB10\111\
Extract the tools.zip to the desired JDK directory (e.g. “D:\JavaJDK\”).

3. Unpack
Now we need to unpack a few files packed with pack200. We do that by executing this script in a console window 
inside the root of the JDK directory (e.g. “D:\JavaJDK\”):

for /R %f in (.\*.pack) do @"%cd%\bin\unpack200" -r -v -l "" "%f" "%~pf%~nf.jar"

Congrats you now have a working, portable JDK!
