Rules on Success




•        “Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS” by Craig Larman & Bas Vodde
•        “Agile Application Security” By multiple authors
•        “Great at work: How top Performers Do Less, Work Better and Archive More

Currently reading:

•        “Tribe of Mentors” by Tim Ferris






Talking about Vodde and Larman, I would definitely add their first two books:
•	Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum
•	Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Large, Multisite, and Offshore Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum
Second one is a great source of experiments and practices to be tried during ongoing transformation.

For scrum masters, coaches, and managers I’d add:
•	Coaching Agile Teams: A Companion for ScrumMasters, Agile Coaches, and Project Managers in Transition by Lyssa Adkins
•	Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  by Daniel Pink

And more about the teamwork:
•	Leading Teams: Setting the Stage for Great Performances Richard Hackman
•	The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni



Probably the ultimate solution for digital library would be getting an access to Safari Books service: http://safaribooksonline.com/
They’ve got most of the books that one would like to read while becoming more agile.
