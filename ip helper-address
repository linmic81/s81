The ip helper-address command configures the device as a DHCP relay agent.
The DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP requests and replies between clients and servers 
when they are not on the same physical subnet.

DHCP requests are broadcasts.  Routers (Layer 3 devices) suppress broadcast traffic.
So if the DHCP server resides in a remote network, a DHCP relay agent is required 
to handle the requests beyond the local subnet.
